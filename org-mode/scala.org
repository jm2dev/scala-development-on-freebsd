* SBT

Everything we need is going to be managed by [[http://scala-sbt.org][sbt]].

Following the installation instructions we end up with a shell script
to launch the application, which is saved relatively to this script.

Inside $HOME/bin I saved the sbt launcher jar file under a directory
named with its version, and I created a symbolic link to easily swap
versions.

#+NAME: bin/sbt
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#!/bin/sh

java -Xmx1024M -jar `dirname $0`/sbt-latest/sbt-launch.jar "$@"
#+END_SRC

* Giter8

[[https://github.com/n8han/giter8][giter8]] is a nice utility to bootstrap scala projects, creating a
barebone project to start coding inmediately and saved time setting up
new projects.

First we will install [[https://github.com/n8han/conscript#readme][Conscript]] and we will use it to install giter8
for us.

#+NAME: Conscript installation.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl https://raw.github.com/n8han/conscript/master/setup.sh | sh
#+END_SRC

#+NAME: Giter8 installation.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cs n8han/giter8
#+END_SRC
